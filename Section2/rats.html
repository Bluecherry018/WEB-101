            <p>Once on a time, as Aesop did report,<br>
                A little Mouse came to a riverside.<br>
                She could not wade, her legs they were so short;<br>
                She could not swim; she had no horse to ride;<br>
                So she was forced, upon the bank, to bide.<br>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The fancy rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica) is the domesticated form of Rattus norvegicus, the brown
            rat,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat">[1]</a></sup> and
            the most common species of rat kept as a pet.
            The name fancy rat derives from the idea of animal fancy (the promotion of domesticated animals) or the
            phrase
            "to fancy" (meaning to like or appreciate).
            <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_rat#cite_note-MMratdoc-2">[2]</a></sup> Wild-caught
            specimens
            that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the
            fancy type.
        </p>

        <h2>Differences from wild rats</h2>
        <p>While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild counterparts to justify a distinct subspecies
            (compare Canis lupus familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent
            is
            coloring.
            Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown
            color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue. <sup><a
