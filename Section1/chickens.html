    <p><b>Chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
        originally from Asia. </p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
        the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. </p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or rooster (in the United States)
        and an adult female is called a hen.[10][11]</p>

    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social Behavior</h4>
    <h4>Broodiness</h4>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term "rooster" (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late
        18th century as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English "cock",[20][21][22] and
        is widely used throughout North America. "Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which
        is done by both sexes.</p>
